# JS Deobfuscator

JS Deobfuscator is a web tool designed to help developers transform obfuscated JavaScript code into a more readable and understandable format. This tool applies reverse-engineering techniques to deobfuscate JavaScript code and provides useful features such as syntax validation, copy/download functionality, and more.

## Features

- **Real-time Deobfuscation**: Instantly deobfuscates JavaScript code to a human-readable format.
- **Syntax Validation**: Checks for syntax errors and alerts the user if the input code is invalid.
- **Copy & Export Code**: Easily copy the deobfuscated code to the clipboard or download it as a `.js` file.
- **Custom Settings**: Adjust tool preferences (e.g., formatting style) as needed.
- **Interactive Steps**: Displays the sequence of operations performed during deobfuscation for clarity.
